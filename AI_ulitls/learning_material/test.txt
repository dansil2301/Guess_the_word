                        FOR BLYTHE... AGAIN. MORE THAN EVER.




                                    Acknowledgments

First and foremost, to my friend and editor, Jason Kaufman, for working so hard on this project and
for truly understanding what this book is all about. And to the incomparable Heide Lange—tireless
champion of The Da Vinci Code, agent extraordinaire, and trusted friend.

I cannot fully express my gratitude to the exceptional team at Doubleday, for their generosity, faith,
and superb guidance. Thank you especially to Bill Thomas and Steve Rubin, who believed in this
book from the start. My thanks also to the initial core of early in-house supporters, headed by
Michael Palgon, Suzanne Herz, Janelle Moburg, Jackie Everly, and Adrienne Sparks, as well as to
the talented people of Doubleday's sales force.

For their generous assistance in the research of the book, I would like to acknowledge the Louvre
Museum, the French Ministry of Culture, Project Gutenberg, Bibliothèque Nationale, the Gnostic
Society Library, the Department of Paintings Study and Documentation Service at the Louvre,
Catholic World News, Royal Observatory Greenwich, London Record Society, the Muniment
Collection at Westminster Abbey, John Pike and the Federation of American Scientists, and the
five members of Opus Dei (three active, two former) who recounted their stories, both positive and
negative, regarding their experiences inside Opus Dei.

My gratitude also to Water Street Bookstore for tracking down so many of my research books, my
father Richard Brown—mathematics teacher and author—for his assistance with the Divine
Proportion and the Fibonacci Sequence, Stan Planton, Sylvie Baudeloque, Peter McGuigan,
Francis McInerney, Margie Wachtel, André Vernet, Ken Kelleher at Anchorball Web Media, Cara
Sottak, Karyn Popham, Esther Sung, Miriam Abramowitz, William Tunstall-Pedoe, and Griffin
Wooden Brown.

And finally, in a novel drawing so heavily on the sacred feminine, I would be remiss if I did not
mention the two extraordinary women who have touched my life. First, my mother, Connie
Brown—fellow scribe, nurturer, musician, and role model. And my wife, Blythe—art historian,
painter, front-line editor, and without a doubt the most astonishingly talented woman I have ever
known.




                                              FACT:

The Priory of Sion—a European secret society founded in 1099—is a real organization. In 1975
Paris's Bibliothèque Nationale discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying
numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and
Leonardo da Vinci.

The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect that has been the topic
of recent controversy due to reports of brainwashing, coercion, and a dangerous practice known as
"corporal mortification." Opus Dei has just completed construction of a $47 million World
Headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City.

All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.




                                            Prologue

                               Louvre Museum, Paris 10:46 P.M.

Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand
Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame,
the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and
Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.

As he had anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading the entrance to the suite. The
parquet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.

The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive. He crawled out from
under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide.

A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."

On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.

Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared
through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His
irises were pink with dark red pupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the barrel
through the bars, directly at the curator. "You should not have run." His accent was not easy to
place. "Now tell me where it is."

"I told you already," the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floor of the gallery. "I
have no idea what you are talking about!"

"You are lying." The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glint in his ghostly eyes.
"You and your brethren possess something that is not yours."

The curator felt a surge of adrenaline. How could he possibly know this?

"Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live." The
man leveled his gun at the curator's head. "Is it a secret you will die for?"

Saunière could not breathe.

The man tilted his head, peering down the barrel of his gun.

Saunière held up his hands in defense. "Wait," he said slowly. "I will tell you what you need to
know." The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many
times... each time praying he would never have to use it.

When the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. "Yes. This is exactly what the
others told me."

Saunière recoiled. The others?

"I found them, too," the huge man taunted. "All three of them. They confirmed what you have just
said."

It cannot be! The curator's true identity, along with the identities of his three sénéchaux, was
almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected. Saunière now realized his sénéchaux,
following strict procedure, had told the same lie before their own deaths. It was part of the
protocol.

The attacker aimed his gun again. "When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows the
truth."

The truth. In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation. If I die, the truth will be
lost forever. Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover.

The gun roared, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bullet lodged in his stomach. He fell
forward... struggling against the pain. Slowly, Saunière rolled over and stared back through the
bars at his attacker.

The man was now taking dead aim at Saunière's head.

Saunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret.

The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor.

The curator's eyes flew open.

The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip, but
then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Saunière's gut. "My work here is done."

The curator looked down and saw the bullet hole in his white linen shirt. It was framed by a small
circle of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach. Almost cruelly, the bullet had
missed his heart. As a veteran of la Guerre d'Algérie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawn-
out death before. For fifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chest
cavity, slowly poisoning him from within.

"Pain is good, monsieur," the man said.

Then he was gone.

Alone now, Jacques Saunière turned his gaze again to the iron gate. He was trapped, and the doors
could not be reopened for at least twenty minutes. By the time anyone got to him, he would be
dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was a fear far greater than that of his own death.

I must pass on the secret.

Staggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought of the generations who
had come before them... of the mission with which they had all been entrusted.

An unbroken chain of knowledge.

Suddenly, now, despite all the precautions... despite all the fail-safes... Jacques Saunière was the
only remaining link, the sole guardian of one of the most powerful secrets ever kept.

Shivering, he pulled himself to his feet.

I must find some way....

He was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he
could pass the torch. Saunière gazed up at the walls of his opulent prison. A collection of the
world's most famous paintings seemed to smile down on him like old friends.

Wincing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperate task before him, he
knew, would require every remaining second of his life.




                                          CHAPTER 1

Robert Langdon awoke slowly.

A telephone was ringing in the darkness—a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside
lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with
Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.

Where the hell am I?

The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.

Slowly, the fog began to lift.

Langdon picked up the receiver. "Hello?"

"Monsieur Langdon?" a man's voice said. "I hope I have not awoken you?"

Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour,
but he felt like the dead.

"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it
is urgent."

Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.

                     THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS
                                     proudly presents
                           AN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDON
                          PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY,
                                 HARVARD UNIVERSITY


Langdon groaned. Tonight's lecture—a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of
Chartres Cathedral—had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely,
some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.

"I'm sorry," Langdon said, "but I'm very tired and—"

"Mais, monsieur," the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. "Your guest is
an important man."

Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a
reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon's visibility had increased a hundredfold
after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self-
important historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.

"If you would be so kind," Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, "could you take the man's
name and number, and tell him I'll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you." He
hung up before the concierge could protest.

Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted:
SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He
turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him
was a stranger—tousled and weary.

You need a vacation, Robert.

The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His
usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong
jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way
deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only
accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.

If Boston Magazine could see me now.

Last month, much to Langdon's embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that
city's top ten most intriguing people—a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing
by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced
to haunt him at the lecture he had given.

"Ladies and gentlemen..." the hostess had announced to a full house at the American University of
Paris's Pavilion Dauphine, "Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous
books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms,
and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you
use his textbooks in class."

The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.
"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However..."
She glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. "An audience member has just handed
me a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction."

She held up a copy of Boston Magazine.

Langdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?

The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking
lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed
no signs of letting up. "And Mr. Langdon's refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last
year's Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter." The hostess goaded the
crowd. "Would you like to hear more?"

The crowd applauded.

Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.

"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger
awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. His
captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female
students describe as 'chocolate for the ears.' "

The hall erupted in laughter.

Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next—some ridiculous line about
"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed"—and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again
to wear his Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.

"Thank you, Monique," Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the
podium. "Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction." He turned to the audience with an
embarrassed sigh. "And if I find which one of you provided that article, I'll have the consulate
deport you."

The crowd laughed.

"Well, folks, as you all know, I'm here tonight to talk about the power of symbols..."



The ringing of Langdon's hotel phone once again broke the silence.
Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. "Yes?"

As expected, it was the concierge. "Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am calling to inform you
that your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you."

Langdon was wide awake now. "You sent someone to my room?"

"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority to stop him."

"Who exactly is he?"

But the concierge was gone.

Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon's door.

Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He
donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. "Who is it?"

"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you." The man's English was accented—a sharp, authoritative
bark. "My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire."

Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U.S. FBI.

Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back
at him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking
blue uniform.

"May I come in?" the agent asked.

Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. "What is this all
about?"

"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter."

"Now?" Langdon managed. "It's after midnight."

"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?"

Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Saunière had been
slated to meet for drinks after Langdon's lecture tonight, but Saunière had never shown up. "Yes.
How did you know that?"

"We found your name in his daily planner."
"I trust nothing is wrong?"

The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.

When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.

"This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre."

As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden
upwelling of anger. "Who would do this!"

"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in
symbology and your plans to meet with him."

Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image was gruesome and
profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of déjà vu. A little over a year ago,
Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours
later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet
something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.

The agent checked his watch. "My capitaine is waiting, sir."

Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. "This symbol here, and the
way his body is so oddly..."

"Positioned?" the agent offered.

Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. "I can't imagine who would do this to someone."

The agent looked grim. "You don't understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph..."
He paused. "Monsieur Saunière did that to himself."




                                        CHAPTER 2

One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious
brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyère. The spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut
into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the Lord.

Pain is good.
His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly,
not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were
forbidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him.

The room was spartan—hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as
his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar
sanctuary in New York City.

The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.

Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell
phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.

"Yes?" a male voice answered.

"Teacher, I have returned."

"Speak," the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.

"All four are gone. The three sénéchaux... and the Grand Master himself."

There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. "Then I assume you have the information?"

"All four concurred. Independently."

"And you believed them?"

"Their agreement was too great for coincidence."

An excited breath. "Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood's reputation for secrecy might prevail."

"The prospect of death is strong motivation."

"So, my pupil, tell me what I must know."

Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. "Teacher, all
four confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte... the legendary keystone."

He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher's excitement. "The
keystone. Exactly as we suspected."

According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone—a clef de voûte... or keystone—an
engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret...
information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood's very existence.

"When we possess the keystone," the Teacher said, "we will be only one step away."

"We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris."

"Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy."

Silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death,
had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. Each had told Silas the
exact same thing—that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of
Paris's ancient churches—the Eglise de Saint-Sulpice.

"Inside a house of the Lord," the Teacher exclaimed. "How they mock us!"

"As they have for centuries."

The Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. Finally, he spoke.
"You have done a great service to God. We have waited centuries for this. You must retrieve the
stone for me. Immediately. Tonight. You understand the stakes."

Silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was now commanding seemed
impossible. "But the church, it is a fortress. Especially at night. How will I enter?"

With the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the Teacher explained what was to be
done.



When Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.

One hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary
penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soul of today's sins. The sins committed
today had been holy in purpose. Acts of war against the enemies of God had been committed for
centuries. Forgiveness was assured.

Even so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.

Pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. Looking down, he
examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. All true followers of The Way wore this
device—a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual
reminder of Christ's suffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of
the flesh.
Although Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew
today was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the
barbs dug deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.
